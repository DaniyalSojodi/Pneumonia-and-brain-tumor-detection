# Pneumonia-and-brain-tumor-detection
Project: CNN model for Disease Detection.
This project is for Pneumonia detection and brain tumor detection using convolutional nerual network. 
Different activation function has been used in to reach to the optimal CNN model.
Finally two jupyter notebook file have been added which is for final project. one is for pneumonia detection and other for glimoa tumor detection.
There is also a link for data have been used.
